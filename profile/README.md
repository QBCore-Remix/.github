# QBCore Remix

People May think this is Just getting made to make Drama Like what 
people have seen with Other Forks of QBCore.
But that is not what this is I started this to play around with QBCore 
and maybe other people will 
use it but Ill not be showing who the real person that has made this
organizations For safety reasons and to keep the drama away
